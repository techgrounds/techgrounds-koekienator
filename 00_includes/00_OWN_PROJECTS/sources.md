The number 2 in the output refers to the number of links to this file. In Linux, links provide a method to create shortcuts to help users navigate the filesystem. When you created this file, Linux did some background work to create an absolute link to the file, and a self-referential link to the file to allow for users to navigate along a relative path. Weâ€™ll discuss absolute and relative paths in the next section.
