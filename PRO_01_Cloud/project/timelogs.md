### Daily report

Started on the bicep modules from microsoft training.  

### Obstacles

Bicep it self seems relatively easy.  
Was struggling with the sandbox environments sometimes.  

### Solutions

Found a work around for the not working sandboxes.  
Start one in an other module and then you can start it again in the module you're on.  
Better option than waiting X hours for reset.  

### Learnings

Basics of Bicep
